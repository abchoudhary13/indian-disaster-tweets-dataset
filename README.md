# Indian Disaster Tweets Dataset

## Abstract

The "Indian Disaster Tweets Dataset" stands as a testament to the meticulous efforts invested in curating a comprehensive repository comprising 1000 tweets spotlighting various disasters unfolding across the vast expanse of India.

The dataset is a result of an exhaustive manual collection process, characterized by a systematic trawl through the depths of Twitter, employing specific hashtags, temporal constraints, and nuanced search parameters. This endeavor ensured the inclusion of tweets in multiple languages indigenous to India, thereby capturing the diverse tapestry of public discourse surrounding calamitous events.

Each entry within the dataset is meticulously annotated with critical attributes, rendering it an invaluable resource for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers navigating the intricate landscape of disaster management. The tweet content, serving as the core narrative, encapsulates the raw sentiments, firsthand accounts, and real-time updates shared by individuals amidst the chaos and uncertainty of disaster scenarios.

Timestamps embedded within the dataset serve as temporal anchors, enabling researchers to analyze the temporal dynamics of information dissemination, crisis response, and community resilience.

Moreover, the provision of tweet links facilitates seamless verification and traceability, ensuring the veracity and authenticity of the data—a crucial aspect in the realm of disaster research and analysis. The binary classification appended to each tweet, denoting its relevance to a disaster event (default value: 1), streamlines the process of data categorization and facilitates targeted analyses, thereby enhancing the dataset's utility across a spectrum of research domains.

This dataset represents more than just a compilation of tweets; it embodies a collective narrative—a mosaic of voices, experiences, and perceptions converging at the intersection of calamity and resilience. It serves as a testament to the power of social media as a tool for information dissemination, crisis communication, and community mobilization during times of adversity.
